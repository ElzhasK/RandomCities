          <h2 class="h2">Almaty</h2>
          <p class="p">
            Almaty formerly known as Alma-Ata, is the largest city in
            Kazakhstan, with a population of about 2,000,000 people, about 11%

            built-up area that encompasses Talgar, Boraldai, Otegen Batyr and
            many other suburbs. It served as capital of the Kazakh Soviet
            Socialist Republic and later independent Kazakhstan from 1929 to
            1997.

          <h2 class="h2">Astana</h2>
          <p class="p">
            Astana, previously known as Akmolinsk, Tselinograd, Akmola and most
            recently Nur-Sultan, is the capital city of Kazakhstan. The city
            lies on the banks of the Ishim River in the north-central part of
            Kazakhstan, within the Akmola Region, though administered as a city
            with special status separately from the rest of the region.

          <h2 class="h2">Shymkent</h2>
          <p class="p">
            Shymkent, known until 1993 as Chimkent is a city in Kazakhstan. It
            is near the border with Uzbekistan. It is one of three Kazakh cities
            which have the status equal to that of a region (“city of republican
            significance”). It is the third-most populous city in Kazakhstan,
            behind Almaty and Astana, with an estimated population of 1,002,291
            as of 1 June 2018.

          <p class="p">
            Aktau is a city in Kazakhstan, located on the eastern shore of the
            Caspian Sea. Its current name means "white mountain" in Kazakh,
            which may be due to its cliffs that overlook the Caspian. From 1964
            to 1991, the city was known as Shevchenko. Its former name was given
            due to the eponymous Ukrainian poet's period of exile in the area.
            It is located on the Mangyshlak Peninsula and is the capital of the
            Mangystau Region.
